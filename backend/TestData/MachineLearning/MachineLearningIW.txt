all about optomization
have several characteristics, trying to find the best values
start by creating a base model
several fields that store characteristics of the prototype. 
example: optomizing the geometry of an airplane. Create a class named airplane with fields such as wingspan, wing angle, length, weight, angle of attack, etc. 
Make several instanes of the class, to make prototypes with different characteristics. 
create several different prototypes with a broad range of values
simulate the prototype, get results on how well it performed
basically evolution; the best prototypes survive to the next generation poor ones are more likely to go extinct. 
Slight modicifactions to the prototypes to create the next generation, like mutations in evotution. 
A good way is bell curve.
Find the standard deviation, random number generator input a number into a bell curve, giving how many standard deviations to change the current prototype's wingspan by. 
After mutating all prototypes, new generation, input in the simulation, repeating the process until you have a highly optomized prototype.
